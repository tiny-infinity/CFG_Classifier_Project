Codebase for the Computational Functional Genomics course offered in January 2026 at IISER Pune.

The goal of the project is to build a classifier to identify regions in the genome that are binding sites for transcription factors(TFs).

The first part of the project involves building a Markov-based classifier and testing it via k-fold cross validation. We use Precision-Recall and Receiver-Operator metrics.
